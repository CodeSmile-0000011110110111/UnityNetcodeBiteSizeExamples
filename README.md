# UnityNetcodeBiteSizeExamples
In my own Netcode BiteSize examples I want to cover all possible/relevant workflow combinations of a specific Netcode aspect (eg connection, scenes, spawning), rather than the minimal working solution. I want to learn all about Netcode in detail before I begin applying it to a real project. The result are useful, educational samples on specific Netcode topics.

Currently requires Netcode for GameObjects. But I may port the examples to other networking solutions in the future, to be able to compare them. In the meantime, feel free to fork and port it yourself, then send me a pull request if you wish.
